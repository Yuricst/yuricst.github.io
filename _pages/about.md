I am a PhD candidate in the [**Space Systems Optimization Group (SSOG)**](https://ssog.ae.gatech.edu/) at **Georgia Tech**, supervised by Professor Koki Ho. 
The overarching theme of my research interest is **decision making** - this includes:

1. *strategic decisions* for designing in-space infrastructures or designing space missions and multi-mission campaigns, and
2. *operational decisions* for operating spacecraft (or fleet of spacecraft) to perform its mission, autonomously or semi-autonomously. 

In effect, my research lies at the intersection of Space Logistics, Astrodynamics, and Guidance, Navigation & Control (GNC).

Prior to my PhD, I completed my alma mater at **Imperial College London** with a Master's in aeronautical engineering (MEng) and a year abroad at the **University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA)**. 
In the past, I have worked on the **design of low-energy transfers** to low-lunar orbits as part of the mission analysis team at [ispace](https://ispace-inc.com/), **GNC on cislunar libration point orbit missions** at [Mitsubishi Electric Research Laboratories (MERL)](https://www.merl.com/), and **G&C for rendez-vous with geostationary satellite** at [Infinite Orbits](https://www.infiniteorbits.io/). 

In my free time, I took part in the 11th and 12th editions of the **Global Trajectory Optimisation Competition (GTOC)** as part of the Advanced Concepts Team at ESTEC, finishing up on the second and fourth place, respectively.
In my non-research-oriented free time, I enjoy shooting film photographs, playing tennis, and reading. 

**Research keywords**: Astrodynamics, GNC, Optimal Control, Location Problems, Routing Problems, Scheduling Problems
