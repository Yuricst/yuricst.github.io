    title: "Gravity-Assist Low-Thrust Trajectory Design"
    excerpt: '
        The combined use of gravity assist, low-thrust propulsion, and manifold capture for interplanetary transfers is studied. This work makes use of the Sims-Flanagan transcription, incorporating parametrization of arrival to a manifold Poincaré section instead of a celestial body.
